# Solving-the-2-D-laplace-equation-with-arbitrary-boundary-conditions

I solved potential problems involving the laplace equation with arbitrary BCs. I consider three scnerios: a 2-d box of fixed potential placed in the space, a 2-d ring of fixed potential placed in the space and a pure free finite space. I used the gauss-seidel iterative method for solving the equation.
