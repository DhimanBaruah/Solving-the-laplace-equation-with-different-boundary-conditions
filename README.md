# Solving-the-2-D-laplace-equation-with-arbitrary-boundary-conditions

I Solved potential problem involving the laplace equation with arbitrary BCs. I consider three scnerios: a 2-d box of fixed potential placed in the space, a 2-d ring of fixed potential placed in the space and a pure free space. I used the gauss-seidel method for solving the equation.
